\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

The resulting score on the test data depends on the design of the neural network, as well as on the way, the missing data is handled.
The first few times running the code I used a way bigger network (multiple hidden layers with 64+ neurons per layer).
Interestingly this gave worse results than the final design.
The results produced by the bigger network while ignoring all jet and Higgs candidate mass data were in the 70-75\% range.
Improving the network's design and using different ways to deal with missing data brought the accuracy of the model up significantly.
The table below shows the score on the test data as well as the value of the loss function for all different ways of dealing with missing data.

These results show us, that the model can give more accurate predictions, if we use higher dimensional data, eventhough we lose a lot of events that way.
Using only the data of those events, in which two or more jets have been produced, together with the physical Higgs mass imputed for the missing data in that column brings the accuracy up to about 85\%, which is a significant impovement from the beginning 70-75\%.
