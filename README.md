# Astro598_HiggsML
Code for the ATLAS Higgs ML challenge as project for Astro598.
The goal of this project is to use Deep Learning methods to decide,
whether a simulated ATLAS event contains the production of a Higgs
Boson (Signal) or not (Background).

To run the code, just execute the runscript.sh file,
or alternatively the runscript_gpu.sh to run the code with GPU
support.
